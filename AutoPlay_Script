"""
This script was created with the intent of getting around a websites flow control. As I was going through a training courses videos, I found that the 
website was designed to make the user press start on each video instead of automatically continuing. This was very frustrating which prompted me to 
build this script to reduce my interaction with the site while increasing my speed through the content using Selenium Webdriver.
